1. drag scrolling 

2. blocks fetching :
   Can use block height to fetch in reverse eg: first block in display 
   will have latest block height like 807597 then after that each
   each block will have one less block height i.e 807596,807595.. and so on

3. block infomation display page





To fix:

1) new block fetching is not dynamic with respect to the viewport size, 
   new blocks adding functionality breaks with enough zoom out

2) hover off animation is abrupt, need to make it smooth
